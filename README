This is where eviljames in #slackware/#slamd64 on freenode puts his custom packs.  Use at your OWN RISK NO WARRANTY ETC.

Right now, none of these packages are any good.  I'll change this readme when I have updated
each script to meet the template that I have since made.

In short, EXPERIMENTAL!  Particularly kaffeine, as it was built against a tainted system.  Will have to try that in a vm shortly, this will be updated to reflect that when it is done.


So, what is and is no longer really experimental:
Stuff that I have reasonably well tested, along with its dependency tree:
digiKam
|- jasper
 - libkdcraw
 - libkexiv2
   | - exiv2
 - kipi-plugins
   | - libkipi

qjackctl
| - jack-audio-connection-kit (from SBo)
  - qt4

qt4-4.4.3

liblrdf
| - ladspa_sdk
  - raptor

libgnomecanvas
| - gail

libsamplerate
| - libsndfile (from builds.slamd64.org)
  - fftw

liblo
libmp4v2
mjpegtools

The following are EXPERIMENTAL:
all of compiz-fusion/
Multimedia/kaffeine (particularly experimental, and forgotten dependency chain)


You know the drill.

You should be able to simply download script / slack-desc file and run it at the command line.  These scripts will download the source and build from it.
