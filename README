This is where eviljames in #slackware/#slamd64 on freenode puts his custom packs.  Use at your OWN RISK NO WARRANTY ETC.

Right now, none of these packages are any good.  I'll change this readme when I have updated
each script to meet the template that I have since made.

In short, EXPERIMENTAL!

You know the drill.

You should be able to simply download script / slack-desc file and run it at the command line.  These scripts will download the source and build from it.
